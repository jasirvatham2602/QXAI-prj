# QXAI-prj
Investigates whether a Quantum Explainable AI (QXAI) model that classifies Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Control performs better than its XAI classical counterpart. Implements a VQC–CNN (Variational Quantum Circuit–Convolutional Neural Network) and compares XAI and QXAI Saliency Maps (XAI:86.76% and  QXAI:84.56% test accuracy).
# Motivation and Research Question
# Model Architectures 
# Explainable AI (Quantum and Classical Saliency Maps)
# Results 
# Statistical Comparison (QXAI vs. XAI with McNemar's Test)
# How to Run
1. Clone the repository with "git clone https://github.com/jasirvatham2602/QXAI-prj" on the terminal, or simply download the contents of the repository as a zip file and extract it on windows
2. Open the QXAI-prj folder on the terminal/command prompt with "cd QXAI-prj"
3. The data has been compressed into a zip folder for convenience. Simply unzip it with "unzip data.zip" on terminal or right click on the data file and unzip it on windows
4. Now that the data file has been unzipped, we must install the needed dependencies with "pip install -r requirements.txt" or "pip3 install -r requirements.txt", if pip doesn't work.
