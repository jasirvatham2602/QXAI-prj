# QXAI-prj
Investigates whether a Quantum Explainable AI (QXAI) model that classifies Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Control performs better than its XAI classical counterpart. Implements a VQC–CNN (Variational Quantum Circuit–Convolutional Neural Network) and compares XAI and QXAI Saliency Maps (XAI:86.76% and  QXAI:84.56% test accuracy).
